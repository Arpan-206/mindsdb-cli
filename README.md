This is an unofficial command-line interface (CLI) for MindsDB, created for the [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com)x[Mindsdb](https://cloud.mindsdb.com) Hackathon. It allows you to view and run things from the terminal, making it easier to interact with MindsDB.

## Requirements

To use this CLI, you will need to have MindsDB installed on your system. You can find installation instructions at the official [MindsDB website](https://cloud.mindsdb.com). 

Additionally, this CLI is written in Python and requires Python 3.6 or higher to be installed on your system.

## Usage

Once you have installed the CLI, you can start using it right away. This CLI is interactive, meaning that you can view and run things from the terminal. To start the interactive mode, simply type:
